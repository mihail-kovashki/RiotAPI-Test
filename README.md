# RiotAPI-Test
Simple Angular2 app to test RiotAPI


Simple Angular 2 (technically 4)/Express/Mongo app, that I made to play around with RIOT games League of Legends API.

## Notes
- Riot's API doesn't support CORS requests from applications, so all request's have to be handled trough server (better security anyway);

## Issues
- Since it's just a test app I don't have a permanent API key and it needs to be regenerated every 24h. (Riot's API key policy);
- Riot enforces some strict limits for some of their methods, so I need to develop the app DB a lot more;
- I used an older project as a base for this, so it has plenty of things to clean up (not necesserily my first priority since it's just a test app);
